# SLO exporter
![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/seznam/slo-exporter) ![CircleCI](https://img.shields.io/circleci/build/github/seznam/slo-exporter/master) ![Docker Pulls](https://img.shields.io/docker/pulls/seznam/slo-exporter)

Tool [slo-exporter](https://github.com/seznam/slo-exporter/blob/master/README.md) computes standardized Service Level Indicator (SLI) and Service Level Objectives (SLO) metrics
based on events coming from various data sources. It follows principles from
[the SRE Workbook](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook).
With already prepared [examples](examples),
[Prometheus alert rules](prometheus_rules/README.md)
and [Grafana dashboards](grafana_dashboards/README.md) you can easily
start to alert on SLO in your infrastructure.

## Motivation
After more than year of experience of maintaining SLO alerting based on application metrics
just from Prometheus, number of issues showed up which made it very difficult and unbearable.
Few among others:
 - High cardinality of metrics if we wanted to easily find out which event type caused the alert or affected the error budget.
 - Classification of events ending up as huge regular expressions in the PromQLs.
 - Issues with default values for the computation if no events happened.
 - Need to filter out some events based on high cardinality metadata which cannot be added to metrics.

 This lead us to decision that we need to process the events separately and in
 Prometheus do just the final computation and alerting.

## How it works
Every ingested event has metadata which are used to classify it to specific SLO domain and class
as described in [the SRE Workbook chapter `Alerting on SLOs`](https://landing.google.com/sre/workbook/chapters/alerting-on-slos/).
Additionally, name of the application where the event happened and identifier of the event is also added to ease the debugging of possible SLO violation.
Finally, you decide based on the metadata if the event was a successful or failed one.
Slo-exporter then exposes Prometheus metric `slo_domain_slo_class:slo_events_total{slo_domain="...", slo_class="...", result="..."}`.
This gives you number of successful or failed events which is all you need to calculate the error budget, burn rate etc.
