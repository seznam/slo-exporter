This module allows you to generate events based on access logs sent form remote [Envoy proxy](https://www.envoyproxy.io/) over a gRPC interface.

### Envoy support and configuration
At this moment, V3 of envoy's xDS API is supported. [See the upstream documentation for details](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/latest/api/api_supported_versions) on API versions.

In particular, you have to configure your envoy instance to send access_logs using [v3 AccessLogService rpc](https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/blob/842485709d651a6057b2ffb505ffced21173e004/api/envoy/service/accesslog/v3/als.proto#L39). We currently do not implement handling of other versions.

See a minimal example on how to configure envoy to send access_logs to an slo-exporter instance (envoy v1.15+):

```yaml
static_resources:
  listeners:
  - name: listener_0
    address:
      socket_address:
        address: 0.0.0.0
        port_value: 8080
    filter_chains:
    - filters:
      - name: envoy.filters.network.http_connection_manager
        typed_config:
          "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.filters.network.http_connection_manager.v3.HttpConnectionManager
          stat_prefix: ingress_http
          access_log:
          - name: envoy.access_loggers.http_grpc
            typed_config:
              "@type": type.googleapis.com/envoy.extensions.access_loggers.grpc.v3.HttpGrpcAccessLogConfig
              common_config:
                grpc_service:
                  envoy_grpc:
                    cluster_name: service_accesslog
                buffer_size_bytes:
                  value: 0
                log_name: accesslogv3
                transport_api_version: V3 # needed to ensure that v3.AccessLogService is used
              additional_request_headers_to_log: ['slo-result', 'slo-class', 'slo-app', 'slo-endpoint']
[...]
  clusters:
    - name: service_accesslog
      connect_timeout: 6s
      type: LOGICAL_DNS
      load_assignment:
        cluster_name: service_accesslog
        endpoints:
          - lb_endpoints:
              - endpoint:
                  address:
                    socket_address:
                      address: localhost # exporter host
                      port_value: 18090  # exporter port
      http2_protocol_options: {}
[...]
```
